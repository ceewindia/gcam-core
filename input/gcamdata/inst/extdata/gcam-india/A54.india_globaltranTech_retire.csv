# File: A54.india_globaltranTech_retire.csv
# Title: Transportation technology retirement parameters. Only applies to vintaged technologies
# Units: Years for lifetime and half.life; Unitless for steepness
# Comments: maximum lifetime of cohort. If no retirement function is used; the entire cohort is retired in this number of years.
# half.life: number of years at which 50% of the cohort is retired; using the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
# steepness: shape parameter used by the s-curve-shutdown-decider retirement function.
# Column types: cccciin
